        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main

      <summary>Creating Branches</summary>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <pre>git branch</pre> to determine what branch you're on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>git checkout -b name-of-branch</pre> creates your new branch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>git checkout branch-name</pre> to switch between branches.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add and commit changes as usual.
        </li>
        <li>On your first push, do
          <pre>git push --set-upstream origin name-of-branch</pre>
        </li>
        <li>When you've made all your changes to the branch, go to github in the browser &amp; click the "Compare &amp;
          pull request" button. Add a note (if needed)
          and click "Create pull request".</li>
        <li>To merge the branch with main, click "Merge pull request" and "Confirm".</li>
        <li>Back in the local project, do
          <pre>git checkout main</pre> to switch back to the main branch. Don't freak, the new changes won't be visible
          yet...
        </li>
        <li>Do
          <pre>git pull</pre> to pull the changes to your local machine.
        </li>
        <li>Delete the old branch with
          <pre>git branch -d name-of-branch</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <summary>Tips</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>If you're only adding/committing one file that's already been added before (it will say modified when doing
          git status), you can skip the
          <pre>add .</pre> and just do
          <pre>git commit -am</pre> to add and commit in one step.
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>git diff branch-name</pre> shows the diff between branches.
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>git merge</pre> to merge two branches locally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>git reset name-of-file</pre> to undo a previously staged file. (or just
          <pre>git reset</pre> to unstage all files you just staged)
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>git reset HEAD~1</pre> goes back one commit (which undoes the commit/staging just made)
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>git reset --hard commitID</pre> completely removes all staging and commits that came after. Use
          <pre>git push -f origin main(or whatever branch)</pre> to get the remote repository up to date with local.
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>git checkout -- filename</pre> to remove a file that hasn't been staged yet that you want to revert back
          to before you made any changes.
        </li>
